# Selenium POM Demo

This repository is for the Selenium study group.

The test case of this demo is: 

> GIVEN www.thoughtworks.com is opened
> 
> WHEN I click Insights and Technology Radar on the nav bar
> 
> and I should open Tech Radar Page
> 
> THEN the text of the download button should be "Download"

The git commit history contains 3 commits:
1. Simple test without using Page Object Model;
2. Rewrite the same test using POM;
3. Introduce AbstractPage

They gradually implemented this test case.
